# PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION PROTOCOL

1. INITIAL LOAD SPEED: Aim for sub-1.5 second initial load time. Implement:
   - Code splitting with dynamic imports
   - Aggressive lazy loading for non-critical components
   - Preload critical resources

2. BUNDLE SIZE CONTROL: 
   - Main bundle must stay under 200KB (gzipped)
   - Monitor bundle size in CI/CD pipeline
   - Tree-shake all imports rigorously

3. RENDER OPTIMIZATION:
   - Prevent unnecessary re-renders with memoization
   - Use virtualization for long lists
   - Implement proper key usage in lists

4. ANIMATION PERFORMANCE:
   - Target 60fps for all animations
   - Use GPU-accelerated properties
   - Debounce and throttle expensive operations

5. ASSET OPTIMIZATION:
   - Compress all images appropriately
   - Use WebP with fallbacks
   - Implement responsive images
6. API EFFICIENCY:
   - Cache responses where appropriate
   - Implement stale-while-revalidate patterns
   - Batch API requests where possible
