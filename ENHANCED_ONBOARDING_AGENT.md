# Enhanced Onboarding Agent with Open-Ended Questions

## ðŸŽ¯ **What I Built**

I've enhanced the OnboardingAgent to ask **comprehensive, open-ended questions** that collect multiple data fields at once and encourage users to write detailed responses. This creates a more natural, engaging conversation flow.

## âœ… **Key Improvements**

### **1. Open-Ended Questions**
- **Comprehensive Questions**: Each question covers multiple related fields
- **Natural Flow**: Questions feel like a natural conversation
- **Detailed Responses**: Encourages users to write more comprehensive answers
- **Multiple Data Points**: Single response can fill multiple Personal Data Card fields

### **2. Intelligent Field Extraction**
- **Smart Parsing**: Extracts multiple fields from a single user response
- **Context Awareness**: Understands different ways users might express information
- **Fallback Logic**: Stores full response if specific extraction fails
- **Pattern Recognition**: Recognizes common phrases and keywords

### **3. Enhanced User Experience**
- **Fewer Questions**: Reduces the number of questions needed
- **More Natural**: Feels like talking to a knowledgeable friend
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Still collects all necessary data
- **Engaging Flow**: Users are more likely to provide detailed responses

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### **New Question Structure**
```typescript
private static readonly ONBOARDING_QUESTIONS = [
  // Comprehensive Personal Introduction
  {
    id: 'personal_intro',
    question: "Hi! I'm ATMO, your AI assistant. I'd love to get to know you better! Could you tell me about yourself? Share your name, age, where you're based, and what makes you unique. What are you passionate about? What languages do you speak?",
    fields: ['name', 'age', 'location', 'bio', 'languages'],
    section: 'personal',
    required: true
  },
  
  // Comprehensive Work Profile
  {
    id: 'work_profile',
    question: "Now let's talk about your professional life! What's your current job title and role? What company do you work for and what industry are you in? How many years of experience do you have? What are your main skills and any certifications you have? How many hours do you typically work per week?",
    fields: ['jobTitle', 'company', 'industry', 'experienceLevel', 'skills', 'certifications', 'workHours'],
    section: 'work',
    required: true
  },
  
  // And so on for all 13 comprehensive questions...
];
```

### **Intelligent Field Extraction**
```typescript
private static extractFieldsFromResponse(userMessage: string, fields: string[]): Record<string, unknown> {
  const extractedData: Record<string, unknown> = {};
  const lowerMessage = userMessage.toLowerCase();
  
  // Extract name (first word or phrase)
  if (fields.includes('name')) {
    const nameMatch = userMessage.match(/^(?:my name is|i'm|i am|call me)\s+([^,.\n]+)/i);
    if (nameMatch) {
      extractedData.name = nameMatch[1].trim();
    }
  }
  
  // Extract age
  if (fields.includes('age')) {
    const ageMatch = userMessage.match(/(\d+)\s*(?:years? old|years? of age|yo)/i);
    if (ageMatch) {
      extractedData.age = ageMatch[1];
    }
  }
  
  // Extract location
  if (fields.includes('location')) {
    const locationKeywords = ['based in', 'live in', 'from', 'located in', 'in'];
    for (const keyword of locationKeywords) {
      const locationMatch = userMessage.match(new RegExp(`${keyword}\\s+([^,.\n]+)`, 'i'));
      if (locationMatch) {
        extractedData.location = locationMatch[1].trim();
        break;
      }
    }
  }
  
  // ... and so on for all fields
}
```
