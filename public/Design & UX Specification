# ATMO – Design & UX Specification

*Definitive rules for Cursor implementation*

---

## 1. Philosophy

The design is intentional, elegant, and deeply human. Every pixel, motion, and frame is a commitment.

Inspired by the precision of dashboards, the warmth of playful accents, and the boldness of orange against black, ATMO’s interface balances restraint with energy. It must feel like a partner that clears the path, not a tool that clutters it.

Design is not decoration. Design is the guidance for the user, all of it must be very cohesieve.

---

## 2. Visual Identity

### Color Palette

ATMO’s visual language rests on deep blacks and grays, with white as clarity and orange as spark. Purple gradients extend the identity in brand-only contexts.

| Role | HEX | RGB | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Primary Black** | `#000000` | 0, 0, 0 | Background, the stage |
| **Dark Gray** | `#333333` | 51, 51, 51 | Panels, containers |
| **Gray** | `#646464` | 100, 100, 100 | Secondary text, disabled states |
| **Light Gray** | `#A7A7A7` | 167, 167, 167 | Dividers, placeholders |
| **White** | `#F9F9F9` | 249, 249, 249 | Primary text, icons |
| **Brand Orange** | `#E85002` | 232, 80, 20 | CTAs, highlights, active states |
| **Gradient Mid** | `#C10801` | 193, 8, 1 | Branding gradient, secondary hue |
| **Gradient End** | `#9D3CAB` | 157, 60, 171 | Branding gradient, halo finishes |

**Rule:** Orange must always sit on black or deep gray. Gradients are used only in branding contexts (hero visuals, orb animations, onboarding). Never in functional UI.

### Typography

- **Font Family:** `Inter` (mandatory, no substitutes)
- **Rendering:** Subpixel anti-aliasing, no tracking adjustments
- **Weights:**
    - Bold (700) → Titles, key metrics
    - Medium (500) → Buttons, labels, navigation
    - Regular (400) → Body text
- **Sizes (Desktop):**
    - H1: 32px / 40px line-height
    - H2: 24px / 32px line-height
    - Body: 16px / 24px line-height
    - Caption: 12–14px / 18px line-height

Typography must remain tight, rational, and unobtrusive. Never playful.

---

## 3. Component Framing & Style

### Cards & Containers

- **Corner Radius:** 16px (consistent across all cards, panels, and modules)
- **Background:** Dark Gray (`#333333`)
- **Elevation:** None by default. On hover: subtle shadow `0px 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.25)`
- **Padding:** 20px inner spacing minimum
- **Alignment:** Grid-aligned, left-anchored
- **Framing:** Content should feel modular, each card self-contained but never over-decorated

Cards echo the **Capture IT** and **Ringo dashboard** inspirations: modular, consistent, breathing space around metrics.

---

### Buttons

- **Primary:** Orange background, white text, radius 8px. On hover: slight scale (1.02) + glow `0px 0px 8px rgba(232,80,20,0.5)`
- **Secondary:** Dark Gray background, white text. On hover: orange outline.
- **Disabled:** Gray background, opacity 40%.

Buttons must always feel decisive. Never rounded-pill or playful.

---

### Navigation

- **Sidebar:** Black background, fixed left, icon-first with labels appearing on hover/expand.
- **Top Bar:** Hosts search, profile, and system actions only. Minimal.
- **Content Area:** Always central focus. No competing chrome.

Prioritisation over density.

---

### Icons

- Monoline stroke-based, geometric minimalism (Lucide recommended).
- White by default, orange when active.
- Never filled except in active states.

---

### Tasks & Lists

- Each task appears as a framed card (radius 16px).
- Time/date anchored right, task label left.
- Priority states:
    - High → Orange text badge
    - Medium → Light Gray badge
    - Low → White outline badge

Compact but highly legible, anchored in rhythm.

---

### Modals & Overlays

- Background: Black at 80% opacity
- Modal card: Dark Gray, 16px radius
- Entry animation: Fade in (300ms ease-out)
- Exit: Fade out (200ms ease-in)

---

## 4. Layout & Grid

- **Grid:** 12 columns
- **Gutters:** 24px
- **Margins:** 40px (desktop)
- **Spacing scale:** Multiples of 8px only (8, 16, 24, 40)

**Rule:** Never break rhythm. The interface must breathe in increments of 8.

---

## 5. Motion & Feedback

- Transitions: 200–300ms ease-out
- Hover states: Subtle scale or glow; never harsh inversions
- Buttons: Glow feedback, not color flip
- Modals: Fade in/out
- Lists: Tasks appear with soft vertical slide + opacity fade (no bounce)

---

## 6. Brand Signature

The **orb** — orange into purple gradient — is ATMO’s emblem. It must be treated as sacred.

- Appears only in branding contexts (onboarding, landing, avatars).
- May softly pulse or rotate, but always subtle.
- Never inside functional components like buttons, lists, or text.

---

## 7. UX Rules

- The **editor is sacred**: no overlays may obstruct code unless modal.
- All flows must reduce friction → prioritize keyboard-first.
- Empty states must guide, not decorate → suggest the next action.
- Feedback must be immediate, subtle, human.

---

## 8. Non-Negotiables

- No alternate fonts.
- No off-palette colors.
- No deviation from 8px rhythm.
- No gratuitous gradients.
- No clutter.
