# Onboarding System Fixes Summary

## 🐛 **Issues Fixed**

### **1. "onboardingservices page is not defined" Error**

**Root Cause**: Navigation was going to `/app` but the main route is `/` which redirects to `/app`.

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Before (incorrect)
navigate('/app?onboarding_continue=true');
navigate('/app?onboarding_start=true');

// After (correct)
navigate('/?onboarding_continue=true');
navigate('/?onboarding_start=true');
```

### **2. Missing Import in CenterColumn**

**Root Cause**: `OnboardingProgressService` was not imported in `CenterColumn.tsx`.

**Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Added missing import
import { OnboardingProgressService } from '@/services/onboardingProgressService';
```
