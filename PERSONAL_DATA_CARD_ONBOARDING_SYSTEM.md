# Personal Data Card Onboarding System

## ðŸŽ¯ **What I Built**

I've created a **comprehensive Personal Data Card onboarding system** that systematically fills all the components in the Personal Data Card through intelligent AI conversation. The system ensures every piece of user data is properly saved and updated in the app.

## âœ… **Key Features**

### **1. Personal Data Card Structure Mapping**
- **6 Main Sections**: Personal, Work, Goals, Preferences, Habits, Interests
- **40+ Data Fields**: Maps directly to PersonalDataCard.tsx components
- **Systematic Collection**: Fills each section completely before moving to the next
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress calculation and completion detection

### **2. Intelligent Question Flow**
- **Personal Information**: Name, age, location, languages, education, bio
- **Work Details**: Job title, company, industry, experience, skills, certifications
- **Goals & Aspirations**: Career, personal, learning, financial, life goals
- **Preferences & Settings**: Work preferences, environment, communication style
- **Habits & Routines**: Daily routines, weekly routines, sleep, exercise, stress management
- **Interests & Passions**: Hobbies, passions, values, mission, doubts, projects

### **3. Data Persistence & Updates**
- **Real-time Saving**: Every response is immediately saved to Supabase
- **Progress Tracking**: Tracks completion percentage and missing fields
- **Data Validation**: Ensures all required fields are collected
- **Automatic Updates**: User data is always kept up-to-date in the app

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### **New Service: PersonalDataOnboardingService**

#### **Personal Data Card Structure**
```typescript
const PERSONAL_DATA_SECTIONS = [
  {
    id: 'personal',
